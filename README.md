# proyecto-real-estate-final
Introduction:
This is a project about real estate, dedicated to people who are thinking about investing in real estate. To be able to be inspired by the data and to be able to make a better buying decision. 

Objective:
I have been inspired by the analysis prior to the purchase. Making a previous analysis of the market. To be able to know which is the best area to invest and therefore be able to have a much more accurate profitability.


Steps:
1. Comparison of market prices
2. Search of the districts of interest. 
3. Number of sales in a period of 20 years.
4. Bank and private equity financing 


I have used in this project government databases, so the data is very accurate. 

I have also used scrapping of the most leading portals with the best information in the market.

Using Python for the ETL process and EDA for the data analysis. 


 Result:
  - Use case or pilot test in which we can make an estimation of these and know with our budget in which neighborhood to invest.
